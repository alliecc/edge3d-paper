Foreword
--------
In the spirit of open source and enabling reproducibility of academic work, this code is almost the exact code used in the paper. It has had some minor refactoring and cleaning up of comments. And so, it is quite raw, and rough around the edges.

I will release a version 2 in the coming year as I rewrite parts of it to be integrated with my final thesis.


Requirements
------------
Install the basic Python modules required with:
	pip install -r requirements.txt

This project also relies on Numba to accelerate the logic and enable multithreaded processing in Python. Refer to the [Numba website]{http://numba.pydata.org/} for installation instructions.
